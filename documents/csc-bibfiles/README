==The files==
mor.bib:
Contains anything model order reduction related including
applications. Papers on helper problems like solvers for matrix
Lyapunov equations do NOT belong here.

software.bib:
This is the resource for anything software related. Mostly manuals and
WWW references go here.

csc.bib:
Everything else goes in here.


Note that these files are supposed to be disjoint!

All files are located in the group SVN under
http://svncsc.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/repos/mpcsc/pubs/bibfiles/

The formating of the files is the one produced by emacs in
BibTeX-mode. Use the emacs menu 
   Bibtex-Edit -> Operation on Buffer ->

   	       -> Validate Entries
	       -> Sort Entries
	       -> Reformat Entries

to ensure you have the proper formatting. 
If you can not use emacs:
 - Sorting is performed according to the bibtex keys.
 - try to adapt the formating found in the other entries.
 
JabRef can be used to do the sorting, but will destroy the formating
of the entries. 

MOST IMPORTANTLY:
When checking in your changes to the SVN repository, please make sure 
you give a meaningful log message telling which entries have been added, 
upated or whatever. Since not everyone is using emacs the formatting of the 
entries and their sorting will change depending on the editor and it will
be almost impossible to keep track of the actual changes otherwise.

==Comparing multiple bib-files==
If you need to compare (e.g. to merge them) two bibfiles.
It is a good idea to use the same editor (preferably emacs using the
above) to ensure the same sorting and formating in both files and then
use a graphical diff tool (e.g. mgdiff, kdiff3, xxdiff,...) to check
for the differences. Most of those tools can perform merge operations
already. Currently (summer 2011) these tools are not automatically
installed on our computers, so you need to ask the IT to install one
on yours. 

==Naming schemes and entry format rules==

===Publication types===
When in doubt about a publication type try to discuss it here and on
the group mailing list.

===Preprint handling==
Enter a new preprint as TechReport with all the data as on the corresponding
Preprint server.
Add 
type = {Preprint}

Once submitted add:
 note = {Submitted to }
and change this to
 note = {To appear in }
on acceptance. 

When the final paper has appeared add it as a separate entry with own
bibtex key. 
Then remove the TechReport from the database!

=== Other Technical reports==
Entries for technical report should have a type entry to distinguish them from submitted preprints:

type = {Technical reports}

or 

a more detailed description, e.g.

type = {SLICOT Working Note},


ArXiv entries should be written as TechReport with the following entries:
 author, title, month, year
 type        =   {arXiv e-prints},
 institution =	 {Cornell University},
 number      =   {xxxxxxxxvx},    % i.e. eprint + version
 note        =   {math.NA}          % optionally, the primaryClass



===BibTeX Keys===
Bibtex keys for the entries are formed from the authors name(s) and
the year of publication as in 

  3 leading characters of first authors last name (Xxx)
 +1 leading character of second and third atuhros last names (YZ)
 +year of publication as 2 digits (11)
 +1 additional character for counting if the previous is non-unique

In the mor.bib file an additional leading mor is added.
 
examples:
Xxx08, XxxYZ10, XxxYZ10a, XxxYZ10b
examples mor.bib:
morXxx08, morXxxYZ10, morXxxYZ10a, morXxxYZ10b

===author fields===
First names are abbreviated by 1character. In case of multiple first
names, these are separated by a single empty space or secured space (~).
Multiple authors are separated by an and.

example:
author = {J. F. Kennedy and F. D. Roosevelt}
author = {Kennedy, J.~F. and Roosevelt, F.~D.}
author = {M. {Van~Barel}}

===booktitle fields===
Since Bibtex Strings and standard entries can not be combined be sure
to meet the String format and add the special information such as , e.g.,
years, or numbers in case of conference Proceedings

===publisher, journal, month fields===
Make sure you check the list of BibTex Strings and use existing
strings here or add new ones where necessary. 

Follow the list of the AMS for Mathematical reviews available at: 
 http://www.ams.org/msnhtml/serials.pdf
for new entries

Use three-letter abbreviations without quotes for months like
month = mar,
month = jun,

===pages===
Page ranges should be given with double dashes

example:
 pages = {102--110}

===German Umlaut and other special characters===
Always use LaTeX transcription for any of these characters to avoid
problems with differing file encodings. 
examples 
 ä -> \"{a}
 ß -> {\ss}
