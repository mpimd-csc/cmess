C-M.E.S.S. is the C implementation of M.E.S.S., the successor to the LyaPack
Toolbox for MATLAB.  It is intended for the solution of symmetric linear and
quadratic, differential and algebraic matrix equations with real, large, and
sparse (or sparse + low-rank) coefficient matrices in the linear terms, low-rank
quadratic and constant terms, and low-rank solutions.  :The new version has been
rewriten in large parts to fit the drastic upgrades in the Matlab releases since
2000.
